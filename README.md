### To use my configurations for Vim you have to do the following steps:  

Before you start doing this, you'll need Install the [Vundle][vundle].

1. Download the *[vimrc]* from the repository and put on your *~/* (If you already have one, just add the content to your .vimrc, making necessary changes)

2. Open vim and run
    >:PluginInstall

3. To use the YouComplete me Plugin, follow the tutorial on the [YouCompleteMe][YCM] git page
