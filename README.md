This is a repository with my configuration files 

## Vim
![Vim Print](myimage.png "Vim Print")

### To use my configurations for Vim you have to do the following steps:  

Before you start doing this, you'll need Install the [Nerd Font][font-install].

1. Download the *soft-theme.vim* from the repository and put on your *.vim/colors/*  (if it doesn't exist, create one)
    
2. Download the *.vimrc* from the reposiroty and put on your *~/* (If you already have one, just add the content to your .vimrc, making necessary changes)

3. Open vim and run
    >:PluginInstall

4. Enjoy
